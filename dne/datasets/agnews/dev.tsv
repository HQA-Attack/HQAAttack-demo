Open Letter Against British Copyright Indoctrination in Schools The British Department for Education and Skills (DfES) recently launched a Music Manifesto campaign, with the ostensible intention of educating the next generation of British musicians.

But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.	3
